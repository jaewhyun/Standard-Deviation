# Standard-Deviation
BU MET CS231 Project 2

Write a C++ program that prompts the user for as many as 100 floating point
numbers. Then, the program should perform the following tasks in the given
order. Each task should be performed by a *separate* function/method:
                                          

a.  Store the numbers in an "array" -- can be a traditional array/template 
    based array/vector -- you decide.

b.  Compute the average of the numbers stored in the "array".

c.  Compute the standard deviation of the numbers stored in the "array" (see
    below).

d.  Output the contents of the "array".

e.  Report the average and the standard deviation.
